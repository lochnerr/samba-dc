What have I accomplished/learned in last 7 weeks working on samba-dc

how to build a complex docker container
 - with and without init sys
 - compatible with bare metal
 - in fedora, ubuntu (probably debian too) and alpine
how to auto-build in docker-hub (build hooks)
got experience with docker-machine
got experience with docker-compose
did some aws ec2 docker


Interesting idea...
  start samba-dc with initsys but no service
  do exec -it sammy bash
  do samba-startup inside like bare metal
  should work with ubuntu and alpine okay
  fedora will be troublesome due to SELinux

To Do:

Write init script, check port conflicts, etc.
Validate environment variables
Validate smb.conf
Validate named.conf.templ


Write README
Decide on process startup:
  samba-docker.service, 
  samba-docker-compose.service,
  docker-composer.service, or
  docker-stack.service, or
  individual services.
Decide on provision/run split
Decide on provision/join process

Windows Testing:
  Setup aws Windows 2016 DC win-dc.aws.clone1.com
  Try join to Windows server with aws fedora sam-dc.aws.clone1.com
  Setup a Windows 2016 client.
  Join to sam-dc.aws.clone1.com

Setup ad.clone1.com:
  dc1.ad.clone1.com xenhost
  dc2.ad.clone1.com virtmgr as KVM VM

Test old clone1.com?
  Fix old server for 192.168.33.x
