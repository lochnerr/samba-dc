Upgrading Samba DC

dns/samba
  - 2 or more.
dhcp
  - Married pair.
chronyd - systemd user (non-root) ready.  Works under podman, on fedora and ubuntu, including raspberry pi.
  - Must be in VM because it must have access to samba socket.
  - Or, samba must run as container on host, without Xen???  Firecracker supports unix sockets too.
  - Bootstrap into bare-metal Fedora/Ubuntu(Pi)?
     - Could then use KVM virtual machines, Firecracker VMs, Weaveworks Ignite VMs, or containers.
        - Custom kernel plus any distro rootfs.
           - Host chronyd (Sets clock for host)
           - VM-1 router/dhcp pair(Needs to be able to set dns name for address)
           - VM-2 chronyd server(Needs to be able to get to ntp_signd socket)
           - VM-3 samba dc/dns
           - VM-3 FreePBX

DC1 VM Host (live-xen-fedora) 192.168.x.9
  use /srv/bootstrap/startup to set /etc/chrony.conf pool (done).
    - this sets the hosts real-time clock.
  DC1 VM 192.168.x.5
    container chronyd-server syncs to ?
    container dns/samba
    container dhcp

DC2 VM Host (raspberry pi) 192.168.x.17
  use /srv/bootstrap/startup to set /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf pool (done).
    - this sets the hosts real-time clock.
  DC2 VM 192.168.x.6
    container chronyd-server syncs to ?
    container dns/samba
    container dhcp

DC3 VM Host (virtmgr KVM?) 192.168.x.7
  Manually set /etc/chrony.conf pool (done).
